When was it built?<\/span> <span class=\"answer\">The 2JZ-GTE debuted in the 1991 Toyota Aristo V (JZS147). The 2JZ drivetrain later found it&#8217;s home in Toyota&#8217;s flagship Supra RZ.<\/span><\/li>\n<li id=\"displacement\"><span class=\"question\">2. What is the displacement?<\/span> <span class=\"answer\">The 2JZ-GTE displaces 2,997 cubic centimetres.<\/span><\/li>\n<li id=\"configuration\"><span class=\"question\">3. What is the engine configuration?<\/span> <span class=\"answer\">The 2JZ-GTE uses an inline six-cylinder engine configuration.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span class=\"question\">4.  Who built it?<\/span> <span class=\"answer\">The 2JZ-GTE was built by the Toyota Motor Corporation, Toyota City, Japan<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span class=\"question\">5.  Is it turbo-charged?<\/span> <span class=\"answer\">Yes. The domestic 2JZ-GTE was paired with twin Hitachi CT20 turbine units. Export specification engines were upgraded with a pair of Hitachi CT12B turbine units These upgraded units featured more durable turbine housings and improved internals.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span class=\"question\">6. What is the stock boost pressure?<\/span> <span class=\"answer\">9 PSI<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span class=\"question\">7. What are the cylinder head features?<\/span> <span class=\"answer\">DOHC (Dual Over Head Cams), 24 valves (4 valves per cylinder), on later revisions it featured a Variable Valve Timing and Intake system (VVT-I).<\/span><\/li>\n<li id=\"power\"><span class=\"question\">8.  What is the stock power output?<\/span> <span class=\"answer\">280 PS @ 5,600 rpm<\/span><\/li>\n<li id=\"torque\"><span class=\"question\">9. What is the stock torque output?<\/span> <span class=\"answer\">320  ft lb @ 4,000 rpm<\/span><\/li>\n<li id=\"cars\"><span class=\"question\">10. What cars housed this engine?<\/span> <span class=\"answer\">Toyota Aristo 3.0V JZS147 (JDM), Toyota Aristo V300 JZS161 (JDM), Toyota Supra RZ\/Turbo JZA80.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span class=\"question\">11.  How tuneable is the stock engine?<\/span> <span class=\"answer\">The 2JZ-GTE is highly tuneable, the stock bottom end  is robust up to 800 PS without modifications.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span class=\"question\">12. What do engine tuners think of it?<\/span> <span class=\"answer\">The 3 liter displacement allows tuners to run large turbo applications without extensive turbo lag. This coupled with bullet proof over engineering from the factory means basic breathing mods will yield 3-400 PS while turbine upgrades with supporting modifications will shoot power towards the 500 PS mark and beyond.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span class=\"question\">13. Does it have &#8220;cool&#8221; factor?<\/span> <span class=\"answer\">The 2JZ is one of, if not, the most desirable JDM engine on the market.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span class=\"question\">14. How does it sound?<\/span> <span class=\"answer\">A large displacement, inline straight six breathing through two turbos means the 2JZ sounds fantastic. Buttery smooth and sonorous, it has to be one of the best sounding engines to come out of Japan.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span class=\"question\">15. Are replacement parts hard to source?<\/span> <span class=\"answer\">The booming aftermaket 2JZ-GTE industry means that spare parts and upgrade parts are easily sourced. <a href=\"http:\/\/enjukuracing.com\/#_l_2ua\" target=\"_blank\">Enjuku Racing<\/a> in the states, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nengun.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Nengun<\/a> in Asia and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jdmgarageuk.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">JDM Garage<\/a> in the UK all stock 2JZ parts.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Check out this 2JZ-GTE in action..<\/h3>\n<p><\/p>\n<div style=\"position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%\"><iframe data-src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/JXvc2I487e0?ecver=2\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" style=\"position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><noscript><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/JXvc2I487e0?ecver=2\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" style=\"position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/noscript><\/div>\n<p>High power Supra video compilation. 2,000 PS+ 2JZ&#8217;s.
